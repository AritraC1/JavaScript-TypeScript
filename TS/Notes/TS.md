# TypeScript

## About
TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. It was developed by Microsoft and is widely used in modern web development, especially for large-scale applications.

## What is TypeScript?
- It's essentially JavaScript + types.
- TypeScript code gets compiled (transpiled) into plain JavaScript so it can run in browsers or Node.js.
- The main file extension is .ts instead of .js.

## Why Use TypeScript?
1. Type Safety
2. Better Developer Experience
3. Improved Maintainability
4. OOP Features
5. Interoperability with JavaScript
6. Tooling and Ecosystem
